KubeRay is a powerful, open-source Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) applications on Kubernetes. It offers several key components:

**KubeRay core**: This is the official, fully-maintained component of KubeRay that provides three custom resource definitions, RayCluster, RayJob, and RayService. These resources are designed to help you run a wide range of workloads with ease.

* **RayCluster**: KubeRay fully manages the lifecycle of RayCluster, including cluster creation/deletion, autoscaling, and ensuring fault tolerance.

* **RayJob**: With RayJob, KubeRay automatically creates a RayCluster and submits a job when the cluster is ready. You can also configure RayJob to automatically delete the RayCluster once the job finishes.

* **RayService**: RayService is made up of two parts: a RayCluster and a Ray Serve deployment graph. RayService offers zero-downtime upgrades for RayCluster and high availability.

**Community-managed components (optional)**: Some components are maintained by the KubeRay community.

* **KubeRay APIServer**: It provides a layer of simplified configuration for KubeRay resources. The KubeRay API server is used internally
by some organizations to back user interfaces for KubeRay resource management.

* **KubeRay Python client**: This Python client library provides APIs to handle RayCluster from your Python application.

* **KubeRay CLI**: KubeRay CLI provides the ability to manage KubeRay resources through command-line interface.

## Documentation

From September 2023, all user-facing KubeRay documentation will be hosted on the [Ray documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/kubernetes/index.html).
The KubeRay repository only contains documentation related to the development and maintenance of KubeRay.

## Helm Charts

KubeRay Helm charts are hosted on the [ray-project/kuberay-helm](https://github.com/ray-project/kuberay-helm) repository.
Please read [kuberay-operator](helm-chart/kuberay-operator/README.md) to deploy the operator and [ray-cluster](helm-chart/ray-cluster/README.md) to deploy a configurable Ray cluster.
To deploy the optional KubeRay API Server, see [kuberay-apiserver](helm-chart/kuberay-apiserver/README.md).


```sh
# Add the Helm repo
helm repo add kuberay https://ray-project.github.io/kuberay-helm/
helm repo update

# Confirm the repo exists
helm search repo kuberay --devel

# Install both CRDs and KubeRay operator v1.0.0.
helm install kuberay-operator kuberay/kuberay-operator --version 1.0.0-rc.1

# Check the KubeRay operator Pod in `default` namespace
kubectl get pods
# NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# kuberay-operator-6fcbb94f64-mbfnr   1/1     Running   0          17s
